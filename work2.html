    <p>I've used canned black beans but you can cook the black beans from scratch on stove top, traditional pressure cooker or InstantPot.In a cooking pan heat oil and once hot add the minced garlic, sauce for a couple of seconds and add the drained and rinsed canned beans followed by spices cumin powder, red chili powder,salt and pepper. Mix well and cook for a min.
         Stir in your favorite kind of salsa and mix well.Using the back of your spoon mash the beans a few times.This filling will make 4 crunchwraps.You can make the black beans filling ahead of time (a day or two in advance) and refrigerate.</p>

    <p>It's as simple as adding all the ingredients to a blender and blending until smooth and thick. Alternately you can also add guacamole or mashed avocado with sourcream. Take you tortilla. We will be cooking this wrap later so this step is optional. 
    In the centre, spread the black bean filling about the size of the tostada. Layer the queso on top of the black beans followed by cheese and tostada.Next layer on the avocado crema. Add the toppings lettuce, tomatoes, onions, green onions, pickled jalape√±os and finally add cheese. Place the smaller tortilla on the cheese and now we are ready to close.  </p>

<div class="col3">
    <p>Fold the bigger tortilla over the small as shown. It may not join in the centre which is why we are using the smaller tortilla as a seal. Keep folding overlapping some of the tortilla over the previous fold.
        Keep folding until its formed a hexagon like shape.Press gently so they hold shape.The wrap folds may not stick at this point which is ok since they will when we cook it. Immediately transfer it for cooking.Heat a skillet on medium heat and brush with some oil.
    Carefully transfer the crunchwrap seam side down on the hot griddle. Cook for 1-2 mins until it golden brown and bottom is crispy and edges sealed. Now flip and cook the other side in same manner.Serve them hot and crispy.
